A proof is a logical and structured argument to show that a mathematical statement or conjecture is always true. 
A statement that has been proven is called a **theorem** whereas a statement that has not been proven is called a **conjecture**.
A mathematical proof needs to show that something is true in every case.

In a mathematical proof, you must:
- State any information or assumptions you are using
- Show every step of your proof clearly
- Be logical
- Cover all possible cases
- Write a statement of proof at the end

### Proof by deduction
Starting from known facts or definitions, then using logical steps to reach a desired conclusion.

In many cases, we can do this by generalising terms (using variables instead of numbers) and then working towards a conclusion from there.

For example:
	Prove that $n^2-n$ is an even number for all values of $n$.
		$n^2-n = n(n-1)$
		If $n$ is odd, $n-1$ is even.
		ODD x EVEN = EVEN.
		If $n$ is even, $n-1$ is odd.
		ODD x EVEN = EVEN
		$\therefore n^2-n$ is even for all $n$.

### Disproof by Counter-Example
Given a conjecture, we try to find a case where the statement is not true, therefore disproving it.

For example:
	Prove that the following statement is not true:
	'The sum of two consecutive prime numbers is always even'
		2 and 3 are both prime numbers appearing consecutively.
		$2+3=5$
		5 is an odd number. Hence, the statement is not true.
