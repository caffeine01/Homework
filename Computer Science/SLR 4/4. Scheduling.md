Multitasking operating systems give the appearance of multiple tasks executing at the same time.
Even within a single program multiple threads may need to be executed at once, e.g. in a game:
- Moving a player object
- Moving enemy objects
- Playing music
- Updating player health/score
In a multi-user environment, a number of users will need servicing, seemingly at the same time.
For this to be possible, operating systems need a scheduler.

A scheduler manages:
- Which processes execute next
- The length of time the next process can execute for
There will often be several processes in the ready queue that the OS needs to deal with, there are several different scheduling algorithms that can help the processor manage this.

**First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- Like a super market queue
- Processes are executed in the order they arrive

**Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- Prioritises the processes that take the shortest amount of time and runs them until they finish
- The scheduler needs to know how long each process will take

**Round Robin (RR)**
- Each process is allocated a fixed amount of time, known as a time slice or quantum
- If the process is not complete by the end of its time slice, it gets moved to the back of the ready queue

**Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)**
- Similar to SJF however SRT is pre-emptive, meaning processes can be suspended if a higher priority process joins the queue

**Process Blocking**
If the process requires external data say from the hard disk, then the process is blocked and a different process is run while the process waits for the required data. Once the required data is received, the process joins the back of the process ready queue

**Multi-Level feedback queues (MLFQ)**
If a computer has more than one processor or processor core, it can handle more than one process queue at a time.
With MLFQ, different queues can have different priorities and the scheduler can move jobs between these queues as needed.

Note: RR, SRT, MLFQ are pre-emptive while FCFS and SJF are non pre-emptive
