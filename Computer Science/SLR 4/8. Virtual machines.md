A virtual machine is a program that has the same functionality as a physical computer.

For example, emulators trick a program into thinking it's running on its native hardware when it's running on an entirely different machine.
Arcade games from the 80s can be emulated on todays hardware, and the programs themselves are completely unaware that they are being emulated, the code is being executed exactly as it was originally.

Virtual machines can be used in servers to balance load across different physical devices.

Java code is compiled into bytecode/intermediate code, this code is then translated by a JVM running on a target device, which translates it into specific machine code. This process makes code highly portable between devices.
