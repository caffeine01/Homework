The operating system control the hardware and software of a computer system and provides a user interface.
The Basic Input Output System (BIOS) is responsible for loading the operating system when the computer first turns on.
It first checks that all the hardware it needs is connected and working using a Power-On Self-Test (POST)

Many different settings can be configured via the BIOS, for example CPU and RAM clock speed and the boot drive.
A boot loader program (bootstrap) is used to load the operating system kernel into memory.
The operating system can take over at this point and boot up the rest of the system.

Initial startup instructions are stored on ROM. BIOS settings are stored in flash memory so they can be changed and are retained when power is lost.
