It takes a lot of time to move a program in memory or on disk, as addresses and free space references all need updating.
There are two main strategies, both involve dividing the memory up into smaller sections:
- Paging
- Segmentation

**Paging**
- Pages are fixed size (all the same)
- Pages are made to fit sections of memory
- Pages are physical divisions
- Programs are split up to fit into a given number of pages
- Paging takes no account of how it splits the program, only that it splits it into fixed sized pages
- It could separate the instructions inside a looping condition so they are in different pages but that wouldn't be very efficient as it would be better to keep those instructions together in memory

**Segmentation**
- Segments are different sizes
- Segments are complete sections of programs
- Segments are logical divisions
- Based on logical divisions, segmentation splits programs into parts and then places them in available free space, leaving smaller areas of free space

**Paging vs Segmentation**
- Both allow programs to run despite insufficient memory
- Pages and segments are stored on disk
- Pages and segments are transferred into memory when needed
- Pages are fixed size while segments are different sizes
- Pages are made to fit sections of memory, segments are complete sections of programs
- Pages are physical divisions, segments are logical divisions

**Virtual memory**
Virtual memory is allocated space on secondary storage that is to be used as memory when the main RAM is full. e.g. If the RAM is full and you want to open another program, then the computer will move instructions from the RAM into virtual memory in order to make space for the program.
If more time is spent moving pages/segments from memory to the disk (thrashing) than processing instructions, the computer will be very slow.
