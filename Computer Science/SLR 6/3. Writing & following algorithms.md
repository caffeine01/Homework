# What is an algorithm?
- An algorithm is a sequence of steps designed to perform a task.
- An algorithm may be constructed to describe the operation of a complete system or a particular part of it.
- We carry out algorithms in every day life without even thinking about it.
- When you cross a road you perform a sequence of steps designed to get you to the other side safely:
	- Stop before crossing.
	- Look left and right.
	- Is the road clear?
	- If not, press the crossing button.
	- Wait for the lights to turn red.
	- Cross when its safe to do so.
- Designing algorithms to solve computer problems is no different - you still need to think about the sequence of steps required.

# How to produce algorithms using pseudocode and flowcharts
### Flowcharts
- A flow chart is one method of representing the sequence of steps in an algorithm in diagram form.
- There are different symbols used to represent different things:
	- Pill - Terminal
	- Rectangle - Process
	- Diamond - Decision
	- Parallelogram - Input/Output
	- Rectangle with lines - Subroutine
	- Line - Flow

### Pseudocode
- Pseudocode is an alternative, text-based method of representing the sequence of steps in an algorithm
- Pseudocode can be thought of as simplified programming code
- The prefix pseudo means false/not genuine
- Writing pseudocode allows us to lay down the logic of a problem in an "almost like real code" way without worrying about the rules and syntax of a particular language
