# Waterfall
| Advantages                                                                    | Disadvantages                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simplicity makes it easy to manage                                            | Carries a lot of risk                                                                        |
| Everyone on the project is very clear on their responsibilities at each stage | The user doesn't get to see the product for the first time until the project is near its end |
| clear deliverables                                                            | Misunderstanding requirements can lead to a project that is not easy to fix                  |
| Easy to see if a project is running to schedule                               | Requirements must be very well understood, so this model is not suitable for complex projects.                                                                                             |

Ease of management can make it suitable for large scale development projects, assuming they are well understood and carry little risk.

# Rapid Application Development
| Advantages                                                                                                                        | Disadvantages                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requirements don't need to be entirely clear from the start                                                                       | Focus on usability rather than how the product works - not suited for projects where code efficiency is very important |
| Focus groups involving the user can be used to gather requirements without the need for full formal requirements document upfront | Regular contact with the client must be maintained at all times                                                        |
| Continuous feedback from the client means the solution is likely to have excellent usability                                      | Scales poorly for large projects with big teams.                                                                                                                       |

Good for projects where the initial requirements are not fully understood, as the iterative nature prevents the development from becoming sidetracked.

# Spiral
| Advantages                                               | Disadvantages                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Risk management is at the heart of this model            | Complex nature of risk analysis increases costs - risk management is a highly specialised skill |
| Excellent for projects that contain a high level of risk | If risk analysis is done badly, the project suffers                                                                                                |

Suitable for large scale problems and those that involve a high degree of risk, especially where the user doesn't fully understand their requirements upfront.

# Agile and extreme programming
| Advantages                                                                                                     | Disadvantages                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Emphasises programming, so the quality of end code is likely to be very high                                   | Requires a team of programmers working in close collaboration - unlikely to work well if the team is widely distributed geographically |
| Core principles and processes promote respect and collaboration, leading to a very productive development team | Client must be able to commit to having full time representative working with the development team                                     |
|                                                                                                                | Some of the processes involved in extreme programming such as paired programming can be quite costly                                                                                                                                       |

When the emphasis of a project is on the quality of finished code, agile and extreme programming processes are ideal.
