| Simplicity makes it easy to manage                                            | Carries a lot of risk                                                                        |
| Everyone on the project is very clear on their responsibilities at each stage | The user doesn't get to see the product for the first time until the project is near its end |
| clear deliverables                                                            | Misunderstanding requirements can lead to a project that is not easy to fix                  |
| Easy to see if a project is running to schedule                               | Requirements must be very well understood, so this model is not suitable for complex projects.                                                                                             |

Ease of management can make it suitable for large scale development projects, assuming they are well understood and carry little risk.

| Requirements don't need to be entirely clear from the start                                                                       | Focus on usability rather than how the product works - not suited for projects where code efficiency is very important |
| Focus groups involving the user can be used to gather requirements without the need for full formal requirements document upfront | Regular contact with the client must be maintained at all times                                                        |
| Continuous feedback from the client means the solution is likely to have excellent usability                                      | Scales poorly for large projects with big teams.                                                                                                                       |

Good for projects where the initial requirements are not fully understood, as the iterative nature prevents the development from becoming sidetracked.
