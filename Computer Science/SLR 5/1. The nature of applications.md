**Generic applications**
- A word processor is an example of a generic application, it does not have a specialised/narrow purpose.
- You can use it to carry out different tasks and meet multiple needs.
- You can use it for tasks that may be better suited for a bespoke application (e.g. making a poster or a flyer)
- Generic applications tend to be the most commonly installed and used products as they allow the user to be productive in a variety of ways
**Specific Applications**
- Database software is an example of a specific application. Beyond creating, managing and using a database it has little use.
- Being highly specific makes it almost essential for creating a serious database application.
- While some features may be found in other applications, you would soon hit a road block.
- Specific application software tends to only be installed on systems where there is a direct need.

Note: In an exam **do not** use brand names for software.
