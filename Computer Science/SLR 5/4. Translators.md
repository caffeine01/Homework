As humans, we pick a programming language and write source code.
Source code is descriptive and easy for us to understand, read, maintain and debug.
However, computers cannot directly understand source code and so it is converted into pure binary so that it can be understood.
This pure binary form of our source code is called machine code.
The process of converting source code to machine code is called translation.

| Description   | Translates assembly language into binary machine code which can be recognised by a specific type of processor.                                                                            | Translates the whole source code of a high level language into object code and then machine code to be processed by the CPU.                            | Translates source code from high level languages into machine code line by line.                                                                                         |
| Advantages    | Memory efficient. Execution speed is faster. Hardware oriented. Requires fewer instructions to achieve the same result.                                                                   | No need for translation at runtime. Speed of execution is faster than interpreted code. Code is usually optimised. Original source code is kept secret. | Easy to write source code as the program will always stop when it finds a syntax error. Code does not need to be recompiled when it is changed. Very easy for beginners. |
| Disadvantages | Long programs written in such languages cannot be executed on small computers. It takes a lot of time to write the code. Difficult syntax. Lack of portability between CPU architectures. | Source code is easier to write. Code needs to be recompiled when it is changed. Compiled code targets a specific type of processor architecture.        | Translation software is required to execute the code. Speed of execution is slower. Code is not optimised. Source code is required to be shipped.                                                                                                                                                                         |
