Programmers aim to write easily readable and modifiable source code.
A processor cannot run source code - it needs to be translated into machine code.
During the compilation process, a compiler runs through a series of parses.
With each parse, the compiler performs different actions on the source code.
Each parse is designed to carry out set tasks and prepare the code for the next stage of compilation.

**Stage 1: Lexical analysis**
- The lexer stars by converting lexemes in the source code into a series of tokens.
- As the lexer reads the source code, it scans the code letter by letter.
- When it encounters a white space, operator symbol or special symbol, it decides that a word (lexeme) is complete.
- It then checks if the lexeme is valid using a predefined set of rules that allow every lexeme to be identified as a valid token.
- Keywords, constants, identifiers, strings, numbers, operators and punctuation symbols are all considered tokens.

**Stage 2: Syntax analysis**
- Syntax analysers analyse the syntactical structure of the input, checking if it is in the correct syntax of the programming language.
- It does this by analysing the token stream against production rules to detect any errors in the code.
- Doing this accomplishes two tasks
	- Checking for errors and reporting them
	- Building an abstract syntax tree (parse tree)
