In the early days of computing, programmers shared their code to learn from each other and evolve.

In the 70s, we moved towards the commercialisation of computing. In 1983, IBM adopted an object code-only model for much of their software and stopped shipping source code. In 1983, the Apple vs Franklin court case verdict made binary files copyrightable.
