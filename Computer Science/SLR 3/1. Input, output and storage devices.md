An input device is any device that allows you to pass information from the outside world into a computer system. e.g. Mouse, Keyboard, Pen-Tablet.

An output device is any device that can take data stored in a digital form and convert it into another format that humans can understand such as sound, image or vibrations. e.g. Monitor, Speakers, Printer.

A storage device is any device used for storage of data. e.g. an SSD, RAM, DVD.

Sometimes things can be both input and output devices, for example, a dualshock 4 controller outputs vibration feedback to in-game events, while simultaneously acting as an input device. These are typically entire embedded systems, though.
