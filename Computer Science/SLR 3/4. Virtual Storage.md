# Virtual Storage
Virtual storage, often referred to as "Cloud Storage" is the concept of storing and retrieving of data over the internet instead of a local storage device.

**Advantages**
- Data can be accessed at any time from any device as long as the device can access the internet.
- Data can be easily shared as there is no need for a physical exchange.
- Collaboration on things such as Photoshop projects becomes much easier.
- Storage can be "limitless" from the perspective of the end user.
**Disadvantages**
- Can become quite expensive as most cloud storage providers will charge a subscription fee, and hosting your own server comes with its own costs too.
- If connectivity is slow then transfer speeds are also slow.
- No internet connection means no access to your files. i.e. if you do not have physical access to the data, then the data is not yours.

Although data stored in virtual storage is referred to as being stored "in the cloud", the data actually resides in a physical storage media in some remote location/data centre.

# Logical vs Physical storage
Virtual storage can also refer to the abstraction of logical storage from physical storage.

For example, a singular shared drive on a school network could look just like a standard storage device/location when in reality it is just a logical abstraction of a physical storage implementation that could be a mixture of magnetic hard discs, solid state drives, network file servers or cloud storage.
