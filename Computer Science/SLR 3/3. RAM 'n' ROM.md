# ROM
ROM stands for Read Only Memory and is typically a small chip located on a motherboard.
It is non-volatile meaning that the data stored in it persists after a loss of power.
It contains the very first instructions that are to be executed by the CPU. 
In a typical computer, these first instructions are the POST (Power On Self Test) sequence which checks that the computer has the required components to load the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) and that these components are working. This is called "firmware" and in most cases the ROM chip can be "flashed" so that the software can be updated.

# RAM
The RAM is temporary, fast access storage that holds instructions and data that are currently in use by the CPU. RAM is used instead of secondary storage as reading from and writing to secondary storage is far slower.
It is volatile meaning that the data stored inside of it is lost after a loss of power.
It also contains the OS kernel when the computer is running.
