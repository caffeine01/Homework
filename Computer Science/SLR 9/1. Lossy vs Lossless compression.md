The purpose of compression is to:
- Reduce the size of files
- Reduce download times
- Reduce storage requirements
- Make the best use of bandwidth

Reducing a file's size can significantly reduce transmission times.

Compression achieves its goals by reducing the overall size of a file as much as possible.

There are two different methods of compression:
- Lossy
- Lossless

Both reduce file size but in different ways.

When a compressed file has been transmitted, it needs to be decompressed so that it can be read.

Lossy compression reduces file size by reducing the amount of data in the file. In images, this is done by reducing the amount of colours and/or resolution and so therefore degrades the image quality.

Lossless compression, however, rearranges the data to try and minimise repetition, without sacrificing quality or losing any data.
