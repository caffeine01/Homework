Hashing (precisely known as a hashing function) transforms a string of characters into a fixed length value or key that represents the original input string.

A hashing function contains an algorithm that converts the input data, common examples include:
- SHA-256
- MD5

Since the hash value is generated from the entire input message, any change to the input data will produce a completely different hash value.

The difference between hashing and encryption is that hashing is a one-way process. You cannot get the original string back from the hashed string, even if you have access to the hashing algorithm.

Hashing is ideal for storing things like passwords in databases in order to prevent serious data breaches from hackers. 

Hashing can also be used for quick searching, insertion and deletion of data from data structure.

By using hashing, we don't need to search the data structure to find an item - we just check the hash table with the hash of our query and it will immediately return the item we want, making this work in O(1) time complexity.
