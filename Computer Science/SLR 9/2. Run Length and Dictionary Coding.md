Dictionary coding is ideal for the compression of text based documents. Run-length encoded is better suited to the compression of images.

Both being lossless techniques, they utilise a method of encoding data that allows us to restore the original file.

# Dictionary Coding
Dictionary coding works by assigning an index that we visualise as a table.
Every data item or entry in the file is recorded along with an indexed reference or unique code (sort of like a mnemonic).
The compressed file now consists of:
- The dictionary index
- The sequence of occurrences needed to recreate the original file

# Run-length encoding
While dictionary coding is great for text files, run-length encoding is far better for compressing bitmap images.
Bitmap images are made up of discrete pixels.
To recreate the image faithfully using lossless compression, we need to be able to recreate every pixel.
For example, an image may contain many contiguous pixels of the same colour value, so storing the binary for each pixel would be inefficient.

To amend this, we can store the information in what we call frequency/data pairs.
For example in a 1 bit colour depth image we could store it as:
22W 6B 8W 1B 8W... etc
which means:
22 white pixels followed by...
6 black pixels followed by...
etc.
