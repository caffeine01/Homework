# Immediate addressing
Sometimes called an immediate operand, the value in the address part of the instruction is actually the value to be used, so the memory does not need to be searched to find the required value.
In essence, the instruction ADD 10 literally means "Add 10" not, "Add the value in memory location 10"

# Direct addressing
The value in the address part of the instruction is a reference to the address in memory where the required value is located.
In this case, the instruction ADD 10 means, "Go and find whatever is in memory location 10 and add it to the accumulator."

# Indirect addressing
The value in the address part of the instruction is a reference to a memory location that contains another memory address where the required value is located.
This mode of addressing memory is incredibly useful, as it means larger address ranges can be used to reference data and instructions. 

If we could only ever use direct addressing, there would be no point putting any more physical memory into your machine beyond 4 bits as we could not physically reference the memory locations beyond address 15 (1111)

# Indexed addressing
Imagine that the contents of an array of 100 items have to be added together.
If the first item in the array is in location 10, we would need instructions such as ADD 10, ADD 11, ADD 12 and so on
Essentially we would need to use the same instruction 100 times.
