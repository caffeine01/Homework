Procedural languages are one of the most common programming paradigms in use.
These are also referred to as imperative languages.
Procedural languages focus on telling a computer exactly what to do by way of step-by-step instructions.

Procedural languages lay code out as a series of statements such as:
- Sequence
- Selection
- Iteration
Code is developed in a modular way. Blocks of code identify set tasks that need to be completed.
To achieve this, we make use of:
- Procedures
- Functions
