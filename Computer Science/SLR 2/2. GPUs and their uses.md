**Co-Processor**
- Any additional processor used for a specialised task is called a co-processor
- They're used to improve the overall speed of the computer by executing concurrently with the CPU.
- The most well known type is a GPU, GPUs were initially used for rendering graphics but nowadays they are used to process many parallel streams of data simultaneously, as the number of cores increased.

**CPU vs GPU**
- While GPUs have thousand of stream processors, they typically run slower than a CPU core.
- CPUs are generic processing units and good all-rounders, where as GPUs are highly specialised.
- GPUs are superior in speed but only for simpler operations on larger data sets
- CPUs excel at performing more complex operations on smaller data sets
- They're both designed with different goals in mind.

**What are GPUs good for?**
- Doing simple instructions on multiple pieces of data in parallel, like changing the RGB values of many pixels in a video game due to a lighting change.
- The GPUs highly specialised SIMD technique is also utilised for much more than just handling graphics. For example: Machine learning, linear algebra, Stats analysis.
