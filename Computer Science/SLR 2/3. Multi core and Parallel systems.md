**Multi core processor**
- Single chip containing two or more independent processing units
- Each core can fetch decode and execute its own instructions

**Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs)**
- Manufacturers integrate multiple cores onto a single chip, this is known as a Chip Multiprocessor (CMP)
- Therefore it is technically wrong to refer to a single chip as a CPU as it is actually a CMP containing multiple CPU cores

**Multiple Cores**
- A CMP with two cores is commonly referred to as a dual core processor. Likewise, a CMP with four cores is referred to as a quad core processor.

The performance of multi-core processors is further enhanced by:
- On-chip shared cache
- Inter core communication
Although, double the cores doesn't necessarily mean double the performance because:
- There are overheads involved with inter core communication
- Some programs aren't written to make use of multiple cores

A multicore should process multiple instructions faster than one with a single core.

**Parallel processing**
- The performance increase from having multiple cores also depends on the softwares ability to make use of multiple cores
- Parallel processing is the processing of multiple instructions by delegating them to separate processors or processor cores
- The main objective is to run a program in less time

**How can parallel processing be achieved?**
- You could achieve parallel processing by assigning
