**Instruction Set**
- Set of all machine code instructions that a CPU can recognise and perform

**CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)**
- Used in laptops and desktops, for example x86 processors designed by Intel and AMD
- Has more complex hardware
- Has a large number of complex instructions of varying lengths.
- An instruction can take multiple clock cycles
- Physically larger and more complex circuitry which requires more silicon to produce and so more expensive
- Larger energy consumption
- Can't make use of pipelining
- As the hardware can handle more complex instructions, the compiler has to do less work.
- Smaller code size, higher clock speed.
- Makes more efficient use of RAM than RISC
- Multiple addressing modes available

**RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture)**
- Used in smartphones, tablets and embedded systems, for example the Raspberry Pi uses an ARM CPU.
- Has simpler hardware
- Smaller number of simple instructions all of a fixed length
- One cycle per instruction
- Smaller in size and uses less complex circuitry which requires less silicon to produce and so it's cheaper.
- Low energy requirements
- Can support pipelining
- The compiler has to do more work as the CPU has more limited instructions
- Large code sizes, lower clock speed
- Uses lots of RAM (can bottleneck if RAM is limited)
- Fewer addressing modes available
