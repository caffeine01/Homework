### Electromagnetic radiation
Visible light is a type of electromagnetic radiation.
The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous spectrum of all the possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
Remember:
-  The frequency of a wave is the wave is the number of complete waves passing a point per second.
- The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two adjacent peaks (crests) of a wave.
Electromagnetic radiation is split up into seven different types based on the frequency of the radiation and its properties.
- Radio Waves (Highest wavelength)
- Microwaves
- Infrared
- Visible Light
- Ultraviolet
- X-Rays
- Gamma Rays (Highest frequency)
The higher the frequency of an electromagnetic wave, the greater its energy.

### Photons
When Max Planck was investigating thermal (Black body) radiation, he suggested that electromagnetic waves can only be released in discrete packets or "quanta".
Einstein expanded upon this by suggesting that electromagnetic waves and the energy they carry can only exist in discrete packets. He called these discrete wave packets "Photons".
The energy carried by one of these photons had to be:
$$E=hf$$
$E$ being the energy of one photon in Joules, $h$ being Planck's constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}Js$) and $f$ being the frequency of light in Hz.

The frequency, wavelength and speed of light are related by:
$$f=\frac{c}{\lambda}$$
You can substitute this equation into $E=hf$ to give another equation for the energy of one photon:
$$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

### Antiparticles
For every particle, there is a corresponding antiparticle with the same mass and rest energy but opposite charge (if charged). For instance, an antiproton is a negatively charged particle with the same mass as the proton. The antineutrino released in beta decay is the antiparticle of a neutrino.
All particles are known as matter, so antiparticles are known as antimatter.
