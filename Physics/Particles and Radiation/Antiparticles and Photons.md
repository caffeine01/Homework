### Electromagnetic radiation
Visible light is a type of electromagnetic radiation.
The electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous spectrum of all the possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
Remember:
-  The frequency of a wave is the wave is the number of complete waves passing a point per second.
- The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two adjacent peaks (crests) of a wave.
Electromagnetic radiation is split up into seven different types based on the frequency of the radiation and its properties.
- Radio Waves (Highest wavelength)
- Microwaves
- Infrared
- Visible Light
- Ultraviolet
- X-Rays
- Gamma Rays (Highest frequency)
The higher the frequency of an electromagnetic wave, the greater its energy.

### Photons
When Max Planck was investigating thermal (Black body) radiation, he suggested that electromagnetic waves can only be released in discrete packets or "quanta".
Einstein expanded upon this by suggesting that electromagnetic waves and the energy they carry can only exist in discrete packets. He called these discrete wave packets "Photons".
The energy carried by one of these photons had to be:
$$E=hf$$
$E$ being the energy of one photon in Joules, $h$ being Planck's constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}Js$) and $f$ being the frequency of light in Hz.

The frequency, wavelength and speed of light are related by:
$$f=\frac{c}{\lambda}$$
You can substitute this equation into $E=hf$ to give another equation for the energy of one photon:
$$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

### Antiparticles
For every particle, there is a corresponding antiparticle with the same mass and rest energy but opposite charge (if charged). For instance, an antiproton is a negatively charged particle with the same mass as the proton. The antineutrino released in beta decay is the antiparticle of a neutrino.
All particles are known as matter, so antiparticles are known as antimatter.

### Pair production
One of Einsteins famous theories states that you can convert mass to energy and vice versa. When energy is converted into mass you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter, this is called pair production.
Pair production only happens if there is enough energy to produce the masses of the particles. It must always produce a particle and its corresponding antiparticle because certain quantities must be conserved.

For example, if we fire two protons with a high amount of kinetic energy at each other we will end up with a lot of energy at the point of impact. This energy may be converted into more particles, if an extra proton is formed then there will always be an antiproton formed too.

If a photon has enough energy (e.g. a gamma ray photon), it can produce an electron-positron pair. This mostly happens when a photon passes near a nucleus. The particles produced in a detector will curve away from each other in opposite directions because they are in an applied magnetic field and have opposite charges.

The minimum energy needed for pair production is the total rest energy of the particles that are produced. The rest energy ($E_0$) of a particle is the amount of energy that would be produced if all of its mass was transformed into energy. Pair production always produces a particle and an antiparticle, so the minimum energy needed is at least $2E_0$ (in order for energy to be conserved).
$$E_{min}=2E_0$$
$E_{min}$ being the minimum energy needed in $MeV$.
$2E_0$ being the rest energy of the particle type produced in $MeV$.

You typically get an electron-positron pair produced rather than any other pair as they have a relatively low mass and therefore a low rest energy, so less energy is needed for the pair production to occur.

### Annihilation
When a particle meets its antiparticle, the result is annihilation. All the mass of the particle and antiparticle gets converted back into energy in the form of two gamma ray photons. Antiparticles can usually only exist for a fraction of a second before this happens, which is why you don't get them in ordinary matter.

You can calculate the minimum energy needed of a photon produced by annihilation. The two photons need to have a total energy of at least 
$2E_0$ for energy to be conserved in this interaction.
$$2E_{min}=2E_0\therefore E_{min}=E_0
$$
$E_{min}$ is the minimum energy of a photon produced.
$E_0$ is the rest energy of the particle annihilated in $MeV$.

PET (positron emission tomography) scanners in hospitals put a work by putting a positron-emitting isotope into a patients bloodstream and then detecting the gamma rays produced by the electron-positron annihilation that occurs. The gamma rays are always produced in pairs which move in opposite directions, so they're easy to distinguish from other gamma rays. The radiation is detected by a "scintillator".
