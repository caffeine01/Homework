### Inside the atom
- An atom is made up of particles. Namely protons, neutrons and electrons.
- At the centre of every atom there is a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons (protons and neutrons are known as nucleons)
- Electrons orbit the nucleus

The the particles that make up an atom have different charges and masses (C being coulombs):

| Particle | Charge (C)           | Mass (kg)            |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Proton   | $+1.6\times10^{-19}$ | $1.67\times10^{-27}$ |
| Neutron  | $0$                  | $1.67\times10^{-27}$ |
| Electron         | $-1.6\times10^{-19}$                      | $9.11\times10^{-31}$                     |

However, these numbers are very small so it is much more sensible to deal with them in relative units.

| Particle | Relative Charge | Relative Mass |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Proton   | Positive, +1    | 1             |
| Neutron  | Neutral, 0      | 1             |
| Electron | Negative, -1    | 0.0005        |

### Proton number
- The number of protons inside an atoms nucleus
- Is also referred to as the atomic number
- Is unique across elements, no two different elements will have the same amount of protons
- In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons

### Nucleon number
- Tells you how many protons and neutrons are inside the nucleus
- Also called the mass number as electrons don't contribute very much mass to an atom at all.

### Nuclide notation
$${^A_ZX}$$
A is the Nucleon number
Z is the Proton number
X is the Element symbol

For example:
A Carbon-12 atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
$${^{12}_{6}C}$$
### Specific charge
The specific charge of a particle is the ratio of its charge to its mass.
It is measured in Coulombs per kilogram ($C\,kg^{-1}$).
To calculate it you just divide the charge by the mass.

### Isotopes
Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Changing the amount of neutrons doesn't change the atoms chemical properties.
There are many different isotopes that have important uses, the relative amounts of the different isotopes of an element present in a substance is knows as isotopic data.
