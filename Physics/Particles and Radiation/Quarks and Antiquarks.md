# Quarks
Protons and neutrons are made of two quarks, up and down (u and d). There are also quarks called strange quarks.

| Name    | Symbol | Charge | Baryon number | Strangeness |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| up      | u      | $+2/3$ | $+1/3$        | 0           |
| down    | d      | $-1/3$ | $+1/3$        | 0           |
| strange | s      | $-1/3$ | $+1/3$        | $-1$            |

The properties of a particle depend on the properties of the quarks that make it up. A proton has a charge of +1 because the quarks that make it up have an overall charge of +1. Kaons have 'strangeness' because they contain strange quarks.
# Antiquarks
The antiquarks have opposite properties to the quarks. *shocker*.

| Name    | Symbol | Charge | Baryon number | Strangeness |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| anti-up      | u̅      | $-2/3$ | $-1/3$        | 0           |
| anti-down    | d̅      | $+1/3$ | $-1/3$        | 0           |
| anti-strange | s̅      | $+1/3$ | $-1/3$        | $+1$            |

# Quark composition of baryons
All baryons are made up of three quarks. Antibaryons are made up of three antiquarks. The charge and baryon number of a baryon is the total charge and baryon number of its quarks. Leptons are not made up of quarks.

# Quark composition of mesons
All mesons are made up of one quark and one antiquark. Pions are just made from up, down, anti-up and anti-down quarks. Kaons have strangeness, so you need to put in s quarks too (the s quark has a strangeness of S=-1). You can work out the quark composition of mesons if you know their properties.
