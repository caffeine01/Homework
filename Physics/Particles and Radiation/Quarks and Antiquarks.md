# Quarks
Protons and neutrons are made of two quarks, up and down (u and d). There are also quarks called strange quarks.

| Name    | Symbol | Charge | Baryon number | Strangeness |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| up      | u      | $+2/3$ | $+1/3$        | 0           |
| down    | d      | $-1/3$ | $+1/3$        | 0           |
| strange | s      | $-1/3$ | $+1/3$        | $-1$            |

The properties of a particle depend on the properties of the quarks that make it up. A proton has a charge of +1 because
