Nuclei are positively charged, so keeping them stable requires a very strong force - unstable nuclei become more stable by decaying.
# Forces in the nucleus
There are many different forces acting on the nucleons in a nucleus.
- The **electromagnetic force** causes the positively charged protons in the nucleus to repel each other.
- The **Gravitational force** causes all the nucleons in the nucleus to attract each other due to their mass
The repulsion from the electromagnetic force is much bigger than the attraction from the gravitational force, if these were the only forces acting in the nucleus then it would fly apart.
This is where another attractive force comes in to play to hold the nucleus together, the **strong nuclear force**.
## The strong nuclear force
In order to hold the nucleus together, the strong nuclear force must be an attractive force that's stronger than the repulsion of the electromagnetic force.

Experiments have shown that the strong nuclear force has a very short range; it can only hold nucleons together when they're just a few femtometres ( $1\times10^{-15}m$) apart, the size of a nucleus.
The strength of the strong nuclear force falls rapidly beyond this distance, although below 0.5fm the force is repulsive because otherwise the nucleus would be crushed.

The strong nuclear force works equally between all nucleons, its strength only changes with distance.

# Nuclear decay 
Unstable nuclei will emit particles to become more stable, this is known as **nuclear decay**.

### Alpha decay
Alpha ($\alpha$) decay only happens in very large atoms (atoms with more than 82 protons), like uranium and radium. The nuclei of these atoms are too big for the strong nuclear force to keep them stable. In order to stabilise themselves, they emit alpha particles from their nucleus. When an alpha particle is emitted, the proton number decreases by two and the nucleon number decreases by four.
$${^A_ZX} \rightarrow {^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y} + {^4_2\alpha}$$
e.g. Uranium decays to thorium by emission of an alpha particle.
$${^{238}_{92}U} \rightarrow {^{234}_{90}Y} + {^4_2\alpha}$$
Alpha particles are ionising but only have a very short range, if you bring a Geiger counter close to an alpha source and then move it away, you will see the count rate drop within a few centimetres.

### Beta-minus decay
Beta-minus ($\beta^-$) decay (usually referred to as just beta decay) is the emission of an electron from the nucleus along with an **antineutrino** particle. Beta decay
