Many particles and antiparticles exist in our universe, some decay very quickly and so are very difficult to observe. They are all classified into useful groups.

# Hadrons
Not all particles are affected by the strong nuclear force, the ones that are are called hadrons.
Hadrons are not fundamental particles as they are made up of quarks.
There are two types of hadrons, baryons and mesons. They are classified by the number of quarks that make them up

## Baryons
It's easier to think of protons and neutrons as two versions of the same particle (the nucleon), with differing electric charges. The main baryons are protons and neutrons, but many others exist outside of regular matter.
All baryons except a free (not in a nucleus) proton can be unstable. This means that all baryons apart from protons decay to become other particles. The particle a baryon ends up as depends on what it was originally, but all baryons (except protons) eventually decay into a proton. All baryons are made up of three quarks.
### Antibaryons
The antiparticles of protons and neutrons are classified as antibaryons. But due to annihilation, you don't find them in normal matter.
### Baryon number
The baryon number is a quantum number that must be conserved. It is just the number of baryons (similar to nucleon number but includes other baryons e.g. $\sum$) 
- All baryons each have a baryon number $B=+1$
- Antibaryons have a baryon number $B=-1$
- Other particles (not baryons) have the baryon number $B=0$
When particles interact and produce or emit new particles (for example, alpha decay), the total baryon number before and after is the same. You can use this information to predict whether a particle interaction can happen - the total baryon number in any particle interaction never changes. 
### Neutron decay
Beta minus decay involves a neutron changing into a proton, this can happen when there are many more neutrons than protons in a nucleus.
