Many particles and antiparticles exist in our universe, some decay very quickly and so are very difficult to observe. They are all classified into useful groups.

# Hadrons
Not all particles are affected by the strong nuclear force, the ones that are are called hadrons.
Hadrons are not fundamental particles as they are made up of quarks.
There are two types of hadrons, baryons and mesons. They are classified by the number of quarks that make them up

## Baryons
It's easier to think of protons and neutrons as two versions of the same particle (the nucleon), with differing electric charges. The main baryons are protons and neutrons, but many others exist outside of regular matter.
All baryons except a free (not in a nucleus) proton can be unstable. This means that all baryons apart from protons decay to become other particles. The particle a baryon ends up as depends on what it was originally, but all baryons (except protons) eventually decay into a proton. All baryons are made up of three quarks.
### Antibaryons
The antiparticles of protons and neutrons are classified as antibaryons. But due to annihilation, you don't find them in normal matter.
### Baryon number
The baryon number is a quantum number that must be conserved. It is just the number of baryons (similar to nucleon number but includes other baryons e.g. $\sum$) 
- All baryons each have a baryon number $B=+1$
- Antibaryons have a baryon number $B=-1$
- Other particles (not baryons) have the baryon number $B=0$
When particles interact and produce or emit new particles (for example, alpha decay), the total baryon number before and after is the same. You can use this information to predict whether a particle interaction can happen - the total baryon number in any particle interaction never changes. 
### Neutron decay
Beta minus decay involves a neutron changing into a proton, this can happen when there are many more neutrons than protons in a nucleus.
Beta decay is caused by the weak interaction.
When a neutron decays it forms a proton, electron and an antineutrino:
$$n\rightarrow p+e^-+vÌ…_e$$
Electrons and antineutrinos aren't baryons, they're leptons, and so have a baryon number $B=0$. Neutrons and protons are baryons and so have a baryon number $B=+1$. This means that the total baryon number before and after are unchanged (equal to +1), allowing the interaction to happen.

## Mesons
Mesons interact with baryons via the strong force.  All mesons are unstable and have a baryon number $B=0$ because they are not baryons.
You can find mesons in high-energy particle collisions, for example at the CERN particle accelerator. Computer simulations are also used to predict what will happen in such collisions, including the particles produced and their predicted paths.
### Pions
Pions ($\pi$-mesons) are the lightest mesons. There are three versions, each having a different electric charge ($\pi^+$, $\pi^0$, $\pi^-$). The $\pi^-$ meson is just the antiparticle of the $\pi^+$ meson, and the antiparticle of a $\pi^0$ meson is just itself.
Pions are the exchange particle of the strong nuclear force.

### Kaons
Kaons (K-mesons) are heavier and more unstable than pions. There are $K^+$ and $K^0$ kaons.
Kaons have a very short lifetime and will decay into pions.

### Detection of mesons
High energy particles from space called cosmic rats are constantly hitting the earth. Cosmic rays often interact with molecules from the atmosphere and produce 'showers' of lots of high-energy particles, including pions and kaons. These are known as cosmic ray showers. You can observe the tracks of these particles with a cloud chamber.
Cosmic ray showers can be detected using two Geiger counters placed one above the other, separated by lead which absorbs stray radiation. If both counters detect radiation simultaneously, then it is very likely that a particle from a cosmic ray show has been detected (rather than random noise or background radiation).

## Hadron properties summary
Hadrons are categorised into two separate groups, the baryons and the mesons. The baryons contain the nucleons (proton, neutron) and others.
