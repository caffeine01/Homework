We know light as a wave, but sometimes it behaves as a particle too. The most famous case is called the photoelectric effect.

# What is the photoelectric effect
If you shine radiation of a high enough frequency onto the surface of a metal, it will instantly emit electrons. For most metals, the necessary frequency falls in the ultraviolet range.
Because of the way atoms are bonded together in metals, metals contain de-localised electrons that are able to move about the metal. The free electrons on or near the surface of the metal absorb energy from the radiation, making them vibrate.
If an electron absorbs enough energy, the bonds holding it to the metal can break and an electron can be released. This is called the photoelectric effect and then electrons emitted are called photoelectrons.
