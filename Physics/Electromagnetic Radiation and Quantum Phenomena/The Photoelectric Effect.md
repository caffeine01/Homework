We know light as a wave, but sometimes it behaves as a particle too. The most famous case is called the photoelectric effect.

# What is the photoelectric effect
If you shine radiation of a high enough frequency onto the surface of a metal, it will instantly emit electrons. For most metals, the necessary frequency falls in the ultraviolet range.
Because of the way atoms are bonded together in metals, metals contain de-localised electrons that are able to move about the metal. The free electrons on or near the surface of the metal absorb energy from the radiation, making them vibrate
