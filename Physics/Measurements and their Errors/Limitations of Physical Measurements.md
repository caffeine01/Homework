**Random Errors** affect *precision*, meaning they cause differences in measurements which causes a spread about the mean. You **cannot** get rid of all random errors. An example of a random error is *electronic noise* in the circuit of an electrical instrument.
To reduce random errors:
- Take **at least 3 repeats** and calculate a **mean**, this method also allows *anomalies* to be identified.
- Use **computers/data loggers/cameras** to reduce human error and enable smaller *intervals*.
- Use **appropriate equipment**, e.g a micrometer has a higher resolution ($0.1\,mm$) than a ruler ($1\,mm$).
  
**Systematic errors** affect *accuracy* and occur due to the apparatus or faults in the experimental method. Systematic errors cause all results to be *too high* or *too low* by the *same amount* each time.
An example is a balance that isn't zeroed correctly (zero error) or reading a scale at a different angle (parallax error).
To reduce systematic error:
- **Calibrate** apparatus by measuring a known value (e.g weigh 1 kg on a mass balance), if the reading is inaccurate then the systematic error is easily identified.
- In radiation experiments, correct for background radiation by measuring it beforehand and excluding it from final results.
- Read the meniscus (the central curve on the surface of a liquid) at eye level (to reduce parallax error) and use controls in experiments.
### Precision
Precise measurements are consistent, they fluctuate slightly about a mean value - this doesn't indicate the value is accurate.
### Repeatability
If the original experimenter can redo the experiment with the same equipment and method then get the same results it is repeatable.
### Reproducibility
If the experiment is redone by a different person or with different techniques and equipment and the same results are found, it is reproducible.
### Resolution
The smallest change in the quantity being measured that gives a recognisable change in reading.
### Accuracy
A measurement close to the true value is accurate

The **uncertainty** of a measurement is the bounds in which the accurate value can be expected to lie, e.g. $20^{\circ}C\, \pm \, 2^{\circ}C$, the true value could be within $18-22^{\circ}C$ 

**Absolute uncertainty**: Uncertainty given as a fixed quantity e.g. $7\,\pm\,0.6V$
**Fractional uncertainty**: Uncertainty given as a fraction of the measurement e.g. $7\pm\frac{3}{35}V$
**Percentage uncertainty**: Uncertainty given as a percentage of the measurement e.g. $7\pm8.6\%V$

To reduce percentage and fractional uncertainty, you can measure larger quantities.

### Resolution and Uncertainty
Readings are when one value is found e.g. reading a thermometer, measurements are when the difference between 2 readings is found, e.g. a ruler (as both the starting point and end point are judged)
