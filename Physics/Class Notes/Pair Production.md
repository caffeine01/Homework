Pair productions is when a high energy photon creates a particle and antiparticle pair, completely disappearing in the process.

$HF_{min}=2E_0$

Rest energy is the energy of a stationary particle with no field acting upon it. Potential energies only affect a particle when it is in a field.

Anything that has mass must have come from energy, so therefore, id we were to fully annihilate the particle it would require the same amount of energy that the mass came from.
$E=mc^2$ is used to find the mass or energy of the particle where $c$ is the speed of light. 

$E=QV,\, E=eV$ where $e$ is the charge of one electron ($1.6\times10^{-19}$).

$1eV$ of energy is the energy transferred to an electron when accelerated through a potential difference of $1V$
To convert from $eV$ to $J$, we multiply by $1.6\times10^{-19}$
