# Key words
- Isotope : variations of elements, same number of protons different number of neutrons. Some isotopes are unstable and may be radioactive and decay to form other elements.
- Specific Charge : The charge to mass ratio of a particle

Specific charge($Ckg^{-1}$) = $\frac{Charge(C)}{Mass(Kg)}$

The bigger the specific charge, the bigger the distance apart that the two different charges will feel a force.

Kaons are produced in the strong interaction
Kaons decay in the weak interaction
