$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$ SUVAT.

- Assume no air resistance => a is constant
- Trying to find a
- Graph to calculate a

### Calculating gravitational field strength (acceleration due to gravity)
- get balls
- drop from different heights
- time each until it hits ground
- plot data 
- draw line of best fit
- profit
