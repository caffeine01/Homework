# Average speed/velocity
Average speed/velocity is change in distance/displacement divided by time taken over a period of time.

# Instantaneous speed/velocity
Instantaneous speed/velocity is the change in distance/displacement divided by time at one particular time.

# The equations of motion
- The equations of motion can be used when an object has constant acceleration.
- There are four equations relating five quantities
	- u initial velocity, v final velocity
	- s displacement, a acceleration, t time
	- SUVAT equations.

1. $v=u+at$
2. $s=\frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$. This says displacement = average velocity x time
3. $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$. With zero acceleration, this becomes displacement = velocity x time
4. $v^2=u^2+2as$. Useful when you don't know the time.

If starting from rest : ($u=0$)
$v=at$
$s=\frac{1}{2}vt$
$s=\frac{1}{2}at^2$
$v^2=2as$
