The charge of the particles, particularly kaons, mirrors the strangeness as both need to be conserved in an interaction

Kaons are strange particles because they contain a strange quark. They are produced through the strong interaction and decay via the weak interaction.

# Conservation Laws
Interactions between particles can only happen if some quantities are conserved:
- Charge
- Energy
- Momentum
- Lepton number (electron and muon individually)
- Baryon number
These are always conserved.

*strangeness is only conserved in the strong interaction*
