The energy of photons and frequencies are limited, and so we may encounter some metals where we cant reach the work function for the photoelectric effect.

One photon will emit one photoelectron, it is a one to one ratio. 

$\phi = hf$
hf being the threshold frequency.

$E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi = eV$
$hf = hf_0 +eV$
$hf = \phi + E_{max}$

Any particle with a momentum $p$ will have a wave associated with it, having a wavelength $\lambda$ of $h/p$

"An electron is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 100V. What is its expected de Broglie wavelength?"

$100 \times (1.6\times10^{-19}) = 1.6\times10^{-17}J$
$1.6\times10^{-17} = (\frac{1}{2})mv^2=(\frac{1}{2})(9.11\times10^{-31})v^2$
$v=5.9\times10^6 ms^{-1}$
