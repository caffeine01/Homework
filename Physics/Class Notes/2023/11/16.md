The maximum kinetic energy be measured using the idea of stopping potential. Photoelectrons emitted by the photoelectric effect can be made to lose their energy by doing work against an applied potential difference. The stopping potential, $V_s$, is the potential difference needed to stop the moving electrons travelling with kinetic energy $E_{k(max)}$. The work done by the potential difference in stopping the fastest electrons is equal to the energy they were carrying: $eV_s=E_{k(max)}$.
