Alpha radiation is absorbed very quickly because of its mass and its charge, both of those are factors.

Waves (for example, light) travelling tend to behave as waves so we see:
Reflection
Refraction
Diffraction

None of which are particle properties.

With a gold leaf electroscope (a piece of metal with a thin bit of gold leaf attached like a hinge), if we shine light onto the piece of metal then it ionises the atoms meaning it will lose electrons and become positively charged, and due to golds conductivity the gold becomes positively charged which causes the gold leaf to repel from the piece of metal.

When we shine light onto the metal plate of the electroscope, either:
- Atoms are ionised (lose electrons) and the electroscope becomes charged
- Nothing happens

The frequency and wavelength of the light is also a factor, the weakest tiniest wave of light (e.g. UV Range) would cause the atoms to be ionised, but if the frequency is too low (e.g. visible light) no matter how powerful the energy is the atoms are not ionised which is not how waves behave
