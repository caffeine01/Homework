A particle has an energy E and an associated de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$. The energy E is proportional to...
Since $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$ then $v=\frac{h}{m\lambda}$
$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	$= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mh^2}{m^2\lambda^2}$
	$= \frac{h^2}{2m\lambda^2}$
Therefore $E_k$ is directly proportional to $\lambda^{-2}$.

The debroglie hypothesis is about how particles are also waves.

The absorption spectrum is all of the colours of the spectrum at once but there are a few darker areas because of a lesser emission of electrons. 

The emission spectrum is completely dark except for a few discreet energies of photon we are detecting.

The fact that the emission spectrum is discontinuous tells us that the atomic energy states are quantised.

Excitation of atoms is when an electron jumps from one energy level to a higher.

De-Excitation of atoms is when an electron jumps back down to a lower energy level. When this happens (unless its hot) it emits a photon of just the right energy to account for the atoms energy loss during the electrons orbital drop.

As you get closer to the nucleus it is harder to move energy levels due to the attractive forces in the nucleus.
