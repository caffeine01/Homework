A particle has an energy E and an associated de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$. The energy E is proportional to...
Since $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$ then $v=\frac{h}{m\lambda}$
$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	$= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mh^2}{m^2\lambda^2}$
	$= \frac{h^2}{2m\lambda^2}$
Therefore $E_k$ is directly proportional to $\lambda^{-2}$.

The debroglie hypothesis is about how particles are also waves.

The absorption spectrum is all of the colours of the spectrum at once but there are a few darker areas because of a lesser emission of electrons. 

The emission spectrum is completely dark except for a few discreet energies of photon we are detecting.

The fact that the emission spectrum is discontinuous tells us that the atomic energy states are quantised.
