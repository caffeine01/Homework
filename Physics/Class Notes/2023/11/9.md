# Waves
There are two main types of wave, transverse and longitudinal. electromagnetic radiation, water waves etc are examples of transverse waves while sound waves are longitudinal.
Waves transfer energy through a medium.

## Transverse Waves
Transverse waves are the curvy ones, like a sine wave. They have an amplitude, a wavelength, a frequency and phase (there are other properties but i don't care enough). If two transverse waves collide and they have different properties (e.g. phase) the result is interference. When waves interfere they create a superposition of both waves, which is where the amplitudes of the wave at each point are added which produces a new wave. If the same waves collide but their phases are opposite, the result is total destructive interference and you get a flat line (This is how Active Noise Cancellation works.)
