# Wave particle duality
There are certain situations where light acts absolutely as a wave, and some situations where it acts as a particle.

For example, in an electroscope, electrons are only emitted if you have a high enough frequency (this is known as the threshold frequency and is different for every metal).

Increasing the intensity of the light does not increase the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons but rather the number of electrons emitted.

Wave theory states that the rate of energy transfer is dependant on the intensity of the light, not its frequency. This is at odds with the above observations which show light as behaving as a particle.

Note:
The higher the frequency, the higher the kinetic energy of the photon. The intensity is effectively the amount of photons you are emitting in a second.
There is also no time delay, electrons can be released from the energy of just one photon. There is no energy accumulation as would be expected from wave theory.


$E=hf$ and $E=\phi + E_{k(max)}$
$\therefore E_{k(max)} = \phi - hf$
$E$ is the energy of the photon (hence why we sub in $hf$)

The work function (denoted by $\phi$) is the minimum energy a photon needs to eject an electron from a metal.
