# Refractive Index
$$(RI)=n=\frac{c}{c_s}$$
c is the speed the speed of light in a vaccumm
say $n = 1.74$

$$c_s = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{3\times10^8}{1.74} = 1.724\times10^8ms^{-1}$$


### RI across a boundary
When light moves from air into a medium (e.g. water, plastic) it bends due to refraction.

### Snell's law of refraction
When light goes from air into a medium, the light bends in the medium towards the normal.

$n_1sin\theta_1=n_2sin\theta_2$
$n_1$ (the incident index)
$n_2$ (the refracted index)
$\theta_1$ (incident angle)
$\theta_2$ (refracted angle)
