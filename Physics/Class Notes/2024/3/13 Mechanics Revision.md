For graphs, consider if a line is approaching zero velocity or moving away from it.

When resolving forces, resolve the vertical and then horizontal components, compare them, and then if they are equal to 

When you have zero accelleration it is because you have zero net force, to calculate that you need to foirst of all find the net force in the x and y direction separately
