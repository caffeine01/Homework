Refraction, light goes into a medium, bends, and then comes back out normally

Interface: Where two materials meet (for example where air meets glass)
Critical Angle: The angle at which the light refracts along the interface
TIR: Total Internal Reflection is where all the light is reflected back into the material.
Critical Angle Formula:
$$sin\theta_c=\frac{n_2}{n_1},\space n_1>n_2$$

1. Q: What conditions need to be met for total internal reflection? A: The light ray must move from a more dense medium to a less dense medium, the angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle.
2. Q: State two functions of the cladding of optical fibres. A: The cladding has a lower refractive index to allow TIR, the cladding also protects the fibre from scratches which could allow light to escape.
