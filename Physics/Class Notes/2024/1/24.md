# Imagine a dog falling out of an aeroplane

## Force due to gravity means the dog accelerates.
To start, the dog is falling slowly (it has not had time to speed up).
There is really only one force acting upon the dog, gravity.
The dog falls faster (accelerates) due to this force
## Gravity is still bigger than air resistance
As the dog falls faster, another force becomes bigger - air resistance.
The force of gravity on the dog of course stays the same.
The force of gravity is still bigger than the air resistance, so the dog continues to accelerate.
## Terminal speed
As the dog falls faster and air resistance increases, eventually the air resistance becomes as big as (equal to) the force of gravity.
The dog stops getting faster (accelerating) and falls at constant speed.
This velocity is called the terminal speed.

Terminal velocity depends on mass and surface area.
