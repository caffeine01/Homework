Density is the mass per unit volume of an object or material. It relates the mass of a substance to how much space it takes up.
$$\rho=\frac{m}{V}$$
(p - density in $kgm^{-3}$, m - mass in kg, V - volume in $m^3$ )

For regular solids we can measure the side lengths or the diameter and use geometry to work out the volume.

The density of an object is dependant on what it's made of, not size or shape.

# Hooke's Law
The force applied to a spring is directly proportional to the extension of said spring.

$$F=k\Delta L$$
