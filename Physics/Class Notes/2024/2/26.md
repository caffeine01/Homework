### Momentum and force
Force is defined as the rate of change of momentum.
$$F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$ Where $\Delta p$ is impulse.

$$F\times\Delta t = \Delta p$$
(i.e. area under this graph is the impluse.)

$F\propto \Delta L$
$F=k\Delta L$
(If within "elastic limit")
(k is the spring constant)

In springs in series, we add them up as inverse.
In springs in parallel we just add the k's
