# Practice questions
1. Hooke's law states that $F=k\Delta L$ 
   k = Spring constant = $1250\space Nm^{-1}$
   L = Extension = $1.6\space cm$
   $\therefore F=1250\times 0.016 = 20N$
2. $F=k\Delta L$
   $\therefore k=\frac{F}{\Delta L}$
   $\Delta L=0.8mm,\space F=20N$ 
   $k=\frac{20}{0.8\times}$

Stress and strain are both per cm^2.

### Tensile Stress And Strain
A ma


Youngs modulus is : $$\frac{stress}{strain}$$
It is a property of materials disregarding their surface area.
For example, a steel chair leg of differing sizes (but same steel) will produce the same young's modulus. It may have different stress and strain but should have a similar if not the same young's modulus.
