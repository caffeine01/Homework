## Resolving vectors into components
Resolving vectors is the opposite of finding the resultant - you start from the resultant and split it into two components at right angles to each other.

### Resolving vectors into horizontal and vertical components
The components of a vector are perpendicular to each other and so they form a right-angled triangle with the vector.
