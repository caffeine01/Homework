# Atomic Structure
Inside an atom are three particles
- Protons
- Neutrons
- Electrons
Electrons orbit the nucleus.
Protons and neutrons are made of smaller particles called quarks, electrons are their own thing.

The proton (atomic, bottom) number in nuclide notation is the number of protons inside the nucleus, different proton number = different element.
In a neutral atom the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.

The nucleon (mass, top) number tells you how many protons AND neutrons are in the nucleus. It ignores electrons because they are light.

The specific charge of a particle is the ratio of its charge to its mass.
It is measured in Coulombs per kilogram ($C\,kg^{-1}$).
To calculate it you just divide the charge by the mass.

Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Changing the amount of neutrons doesn't change the atoms chemical properties.

# Stable and Unstable nuclei
The Strong Nuclear Force keeps nuclei stable by counteracting the electrostatic force of repulsion between protons and neutrons in the nucleus (as they have the same charge). It only acts on particles found in nuclei (nucleons) and has a very short range. It is attractive up to separations of nucleons of 3 femtometres (fm), but is repulsive below separations of 0.5 fm (as otherwise the nucleons would be crushed to a point).

Unstable nuclei are those which have too many of either protons, neutrons or both which causes the strong nuclear force to be unable to keep them stable, and so these nuclei will decay in order to stabilise themselves. The type of decay that they experience depends on the amount of each nucleon.

**Alpha Decay** occurs in large nuclei, with too many of both protons and neutrons. The general equation for alpha decay is:
$$_{Z}^{A}X \rightarrow _{Z-2}^{A-4}Y + _{2}^{4}\alpha$$
From this equation we can see that in alpha decay:
- The proton number decreases by 2
- The nucleon number decreases by 4

**Beta-minus Decay** occurs in nuclei that have too many neutrons.
The general equation for beta-minus decay is:
$$_{Z}^{A}X \rightarrow _{Z+1}^{A}Y + _{-1}^{0}\beta + \nu_e$$
