# Atomic Structure
Inside an atom are three particles
- Protons
- Neutrons
- Electrons
Electrons orbit the nucleus.
Protons and neutrons are made of smaller particles called quarks, electrons are their own thing.

The proton (atomic, bottom) number in nuclide notation is the number of protons inside the nucleus, different proton number = different element.
In a neutral atom the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.

The nucleon (mass, top) number tells you how many protons AND neutrons are in the nucleus. It ignores electrons because they are light.

The specific charge of a particle is the ratio of its charge to its mass.
It is measured in Coulombs per kilogram ($C\,kg^{-1}$).
To calculate it you just divide the charge by the mass.

Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Changing the amount of neutrons doesn't change the atoms chemical properties.
