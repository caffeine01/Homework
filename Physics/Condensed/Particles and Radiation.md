# Atomic Structure
Inside an atom are three particles
- Protons
- Neutrons
- Electrons
Electrons orbit the nucleus.
Protons and neutrons are made of smaller particles called quarks, electrons are their own thing.

The proton (atomic, bottom) number in nuclide notation is the number of protons inside the nucleus, different proton number = different element.
In a neutral atom the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons.

The nucleon (mass, top) number tells you how many protons AND neutrons are in the nucleus. It ignores electrons because they are light.

$$^A_ZX$$

The specific charge of a particle is the ratio of its charge to its mass.
It is measured in Coulombs per kilogram ($C\,kg^{-1}$).
To calculate it you just divide the charge by the mass.

Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Changing the amount of neutrons doesn't change the atoms chemical properties.

# Stable and Unstable nuclei
The Strong Nuclear Force keeps nuclei stable by counteracting the electrostatic force of repulsion between protons and neutrons in the nucleus (as they have the same charge). It only acts on particles found in nuclei (nucleons) and has a very short range. It is attractive up to separations of nucleons of 3 femtometres (fm), but is repulsive below separations of 0.5 fm (as otherwise the nucleons would be crushed to a point).

Unstable nuclei are those which have too many of either protons, neutrons or both which causes the strong nuclear force to be unable to keep them stable, and so these nuclei will decay in order to stabilise themselves. The type of decay that they experience depends on the amount of each nucleon.

**Alpha Decay** occurs in large nuclei, with too many of both protons and neutrons. The general equation for alpha decay is:
$$_{Z}^{A}X \rightarrow _{Z-2}^{A-4}Y + _{2}^{4}\alpha$$
From this equation we can see that in alpha decay:
- The proton number decreases by 2
- The nucleon number decreases by 4

**Beta-minus Decay** occurs in nuclei that have too many neutrons.
The general equation for beta-minus decay is:
$$_{Z}^{A}X \rightarrow _{Z+1}^{A}Y + _{-1}^{0}\beta + \nu_e$$
At first it was believed that the only particle emitted during beta-minus decay was an electron, however observations of the energy levels before and after the decay were shown to not be conserved. This does not follow the principle of conservation of energy, and so therefore neutrinos were hypothesised to account for this and were then later observed, confirming their existence.

# Particles, antiparticles and photons
For every particle there exits an antiparticle. These antiparticles have the same rest energy and mass, although all other properties are opposite. For example, the positron is the antiparticle of the electron, and an electron antineutrino is the antiparticle of a neutrino.

| Particle                                 | Mass (kg)            | Rest energy (Mev) | Charge (C)           |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Electron ($e^-$)                         | $9.11\times10^{-31}$ | 0.511             | $-1.6\times10^{-19}$ |
| Positron ($e^+$)                         | $9.11\times10^{-31}$ | 0.511             | $+1.6\times10^{-19}$ |
| Electron neutrino ($\nu_e$)              |                      | 0                 | 0                    |
| Electron antineutrino ($\overline\nu_e$) |                      | 0                 | 0                    |

Electromagnetic radiation travels in discrete packets called photons, which transfer energy and have no mass. The energy of photons is directly proportional to the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, as shown in the equation : 
$$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
where h is the planck constant ($6.63\times10^{-34} Js$)

Annihilation is where a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide, and as a result their masses are converted into energy. This mass energy (along with the kinetic energy) of the particles is then released in the form of two photons moving in opposite directions in order to conserve momentum.

An important example of annihilation being applied is in a PET scanner, this allows 3D images of the inside of the body to be taken and therefore making medical diagnoses easier. This is done by introducing a positron emitting radioisotope into the patient, as positrons are released they annihilate with the electrons inside the patient, emitting gamma photons which can be detected by the PET scanner.

Pair production is where a photon is converted into an equal amount of matter and antimatter. This can only occur when the photon has an energy greater than the total rest energy of both particles, any excess energy is converted into kinetic energy of the particles.

# Particle interactions
There are four fundamental forces : gravity, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear.

Forces between particles are caused by exchange particles. Exchange particles carry energy and momentum between the particles experiencing the force and each fundamental force has its own exchange particles. A good way do describe repulsion is to imagine an exchange as a heavy ball thrown from one person to another, as the ball is thrown it carries momentum to the second person causing them to move back. This same principle can be used to describe attraction, but instead of a heavy ball, the exchange particle is a boomerang.

| Interaction     | Exchange particle         | Range (m)         | Acts on             |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Strong          | Gluon                     | $3\times10^{-15}$ | Hadrons             |
| Weak            | W boson ($W^+$ or $W^-$ ) | $10^{-18}$        | All particles       |
| Electromagnetic | Virtual photon ($\gamma$) | Infinite          | Charged particles   |
| Gravity         | Graviton                  | Infinite          | Particles with mass |

The weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, electron capture, and electron-proton collisions, all of which can be represented by Feynman diagrams.

Electron capture and Electron-proton collision :
$$p+e^{-} \rightarrow n+\nu_e$$
The equations are the same, however the exchange particles are different ($W^+$ during electron capture, $W^-$ during electron-proton collision)

Beta-plus decay :
$$p\rightarrow n+e^++\nu_e$$
($W^+$ boson as exchange particle)

Beta-minus decay :
$$n \rightarrow p+e^-+\overline\nu_e$$
($W^-$ boson as exchange particle)

# Classification of particles
All particles are either hadrons or leptons. Their differentiating property is that leptons are fundamental particles, meaning they cannot be broken down any further, and they do not experience the strong nuclear force. On the other hand, hadrons are formed of quarks (quarks are fundamental particles), and hadrons experience the strong nuclear force.

Hadrons can be further separated into baryons, antibaryons and mesons. Baryons are forced of 3 quarks, antibaryons are formed of 3 antiquarks while mesons are formed from a quark and antiquark.

The baryon number of a particle shows whether it's a baryon (if 1), antibaryon (if --1) or not as baryon (if 0). Baryon number is always conserved in particle interactions.

The only stable baryon is the proton, therefore all baryons will eventually decay into a proton, either directly or indirectly.

The lepton number, much like the baryon number, of a particle shows whether it is a lepton, antilepton or not a lepton. There are two essential types of lepton number, electron lepton number and muon lepton number, which represent the named particle. Lepton number is always conserved in interactions.

A muon is sometimes known as a heavy electron, and muons decay into electrons.

Strange particles are particles which are produced by the strong nuclear interaction, but decay by the weak interaction. The main strange particles to know about are kaons, which decay into pions through the weak interaction.

Strangeness is a property of particles, which shows that strange particles must be created in pairs as strangeness must be conserved in strong interactions. However, in weak interactions, strangeness can only change by 0, +1 or -1.

In order to investigate particle physics, particle accelerators may be built (such as the CERN large hadron collider). However, these are very expensive to build and run, and they also produce huge amounts of data, therefore scientific investigations rely on collaboration of scientists internationally.

# Quarks and Antiquarks
As mentioned previously, quarks are fundamental particles which make up hadrons. Each type of quark has different properties, there are 3 main quarks and antiquarks.

For the table below, the properties of the respective antiquarks have opposite signs.

| Type of quark | Charge          | Baryon number  | Strangeness |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Up (u)        | $+\frac{2}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0           |
| Down (d)      | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | 0           |
| Strange (s)   | $-\frac{1}{3}e$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ | -1          |

Quarks are combined to form baryons and mesons. For example, the quark combination uud will form a proton. This is because the overall charge becomes +e, and the overall baryon number becomes +1, meaning the result is a baryon with a charge of +e which is a proton.
The same logic can be applied for the quark combination udd, which forms a neutron.

To find the quark combination of an antibaryon, if you know the quark combination of the baryon, you simply change the quarks into their respective antiquarks. This is also true for mesons.

These are some important quark combinations for mesons :

| Particle | Quarks combination(s)            | Charge | Strangeness |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| $\pi^0$  | $u\overline u$ or $d\overline d$ | 0      | 0           |
| $\pi^+$  | $u\overline d$                   | +1     | 0           |
| $\pi^-$  | $\overline ud$                   | -1     | 0           |
| $k^0$    | $d\overline s$                   | 0      | +1          |
| $k^+$    | $u\overline s$                   | +1     | +1          |
| $k^-$    | $\overline us$                   | -1     | -1          |
As all baryons decay into protons, a neutron will decay into a proton.
$$n\rightarrow p+e^-+\overline{\nu_e}$$

# Applications of conservation laws
These properties must always be conserved in particle interactions : 
- Energy and momentum
- Charge
- Baryon number
- Electron lepton number
- Muon lepton number
Strangeness must only be conserved during strong interactions.

To show these conservation laws are obeyed in an interaction, you find the value of each property before and after the interaction and make sure they are equal.
For example during beta minus decay :
$$n\rightarrow p + e^- + \overline{\nu_e}$$

|                        | Charge    | Baryon number | Electron lepton number | Muon lepton number | Strangeness |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **Before interaction** | 0         | 1             | 0                      | 0                  | 0           |
| **After interaction**  | $1-1+0=0$ | $1+0+0$       | $0+1-1$                | $0+0+0$            | $0+0+0$     |
| **Change**             | 0         | 0             | 0                      | 0                  | 0           |
As we can see all the conservation laws are obeyed, therefore this interaction is possible.

Beta minus and beta plus decay are both caused by the weak interaction beccause there is a change of quark type.
In beta minus decay, for a neutron to change into a proton, a down quark changes into an up quark. And vice versa in beta plus decay.

# Electromagnetic radiation and quantum phenomena
## The photoelectric effect
The photoelectric effect is where photoelectrons are emitted from the surface of a metal after light above a certain frequency is shone on it. This certain frequency is different for different types of metals and this is called the threshold frequency.

The threshold frequency couldn't be explained by wave theory, as it suggests that any frequency of light should be able to cause photoelectric emission as the energy absorbed by each electron will gradually increase with each incoming wave. However, it could be explained by the photon model of light which suggested that : 
- EM waves travel in discrete packets called photons, which have an energy which is directly proportional to frequency.
- Each electron can absorb a single photon, therefore a photoelectron is only emitted if the frequency is above the threshold frequency.
- If the intensity of the light is increased (when the frequency is above the threshold) more photoelectrons are emitted per second.

The work function of a metal is the minimum energy required for electrons to be emitted from the surface of the metal, and is denoted by $\phi$.
The stopping potential is the potential difference you would need to apply across the metal to stop the photoelectrons with maximum kinetic energy. Measuring stopping potential allows you to find the maximum kinetic energy of the released photoelectrons.
$$E_{k(max)} = eV_s$$
Where $V_s$ is the stopping potential end $e$ is the charge of an electron.
This is derived by the equation :
$$energy=charge\times voltage$$
The photoelectric equation is :
$$E=hf=\phi + E_{k(max)}$$
This shows the relationship between the work function, maximum kinetic energy and the frequency of light.

## Collisions of electrons with atoms
Electrons in atoms can only exist in discrete energy levels. These electrons can gain energy from collisions with free electrons, which can cause them to move up into a higher energy level, this is known as excitation. They can also gain enough energy to be removed from the atom entirely, this is called ionisation. Ionisation occurs if the energy of the free electron is greater than the ionisation energy.

If an electron becomes excited, it will quickly return to its original energy level (ground state), and therefore release the energy it had gained in the form of a photon.

An example of a practical use of excitation is in a fluorescent tube in order to produce light. Fluorescent tubes are filled with mercury vapour which is then excited by a high voltage being applied across it.

This voltage accelerates free electrons through the tube, which collide with the mercury atoms causing them to be ionised, releasing more free electrons. The free electrons collide with the mercury atoms causing them to become excited. When they de-excite they release photons, most of which are in the UV range. The fluorescent coating (phosphorus) on the inside of the tube absorbs these UV photons and so the electrons in the atoms of the phosphorus consequentially become excited and then de-excite, releasing photons of visible light.

When describing the energy difference between energy levels, the values of energy are very small, therefore the unit electron volts (eV) is used instead of joules (J). An electron volt is defined as the energy gained by one electron when passing through a potential difference of 1 volt.

We know that $energy = charge \times voltage$, therefore $1eV= e\times 1= 1.6\times10^{-19}$.
And so to convert from eV to joules, you multiply the value by $1.6\times10^{-19}$.
To convert from joules to eV, divide your value by $1.6\times10^{-19}$.

## Energy levels and photon emission
By passing the light from a fluorescent tube through a diffraction grating or prism, you get a line spectrum. Each line in the spectrum will represent a different wavelength of light emitted by the tube. As this spectrum is not continuous but rather contains only discrete values of wavelength, the only photon energies emitted will correspond to these wavelengths, therefore this is evidence to show that electrons in atoms can only transition between discrete energy levels.

You can also do this by passing white light through a cooled gas, however you would get a line absorption spectrum which looks like a continuous spectrum of all possible wavelengths of light, with black lines at certain wavelengths. These black lines represent the possible differences in energy levels as the atoms in the gas can only absorb photons of an energy equal to the exact difference between two energy levels.

The difference between two energy levels is equal to a specific photon energy emitted by a fluorescent tube, or absorbed in a line absorption spectrum. Therefore : $$\Delta E=E_1-E_2$$
Where $E_1$ and $E_2$ represent energy levels.
$$E=hf, hf=E_1-E_2$$
## Wave-particle duality
Light can be shown as having both wave and particle properties. Examples of light acting as a wave are diffraction and interference, while an example of light acting as a particle is the photoelectric effect.

Electrons can also be shown as having both wave and particle properties, as the wave nature of electrons can be observed through electron diffraction, as only waves can experience diffraction.

De Broglie hypothesised that if light was shown to have particle properties, then particles should also have wave-like properties, and he wrote an equation relating the wavelength ($\lambda$) of an object to its momentum ($mv$) : $$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$
Where h is the planck constant.

Using the above equation you can see how the amount of diffraction changes as a particle's momentum changes. When the momentum is increased, the wavelength will decrease, and therefore the amount of diffraction decreases, meaning that the concentric rings of the interference pattern become closer. Whereas, when momentum is decreased, the wavelength increases, meaning the amount of diffraction increases and so the rings move further apart.

Scientists did not always agree that matter had this wave-particle duality, however as time went on and experimental evidence for this phenomena was gathered (notably electron diffraction and the photoelectric effect), it was eventually accepted. Knowledge and understanding of science changes over time in accordance to the experimental evidence gathered by the scientific community. However these pieces of experimental evidence must be published and then peer-reviewed by the community in order to become validated and eventually accepted.
