# Uses of SI units and their prefixes
**SI units** are the **fundamental** units, they are made up of:
- Mass (m): **kg** (kilograms)
- Length (l (L) ): **m** (metres)
- Time (t): **s** (seconds)
- Amount of substance (n): **mol** (moles)
- Temperature (t): **K** (kelvin)
- Electric current (I): **A** (amperes)

The SI units of quantities can be **derived** by their equation, e.g. $F=ma$
For example, to find the SI units of force (F) multiply the units of mass and acceleration $kg\times ms^{-2}$ gives $kgms^{-2}$ (Also known as N)

The SI units of voltage can be found by a series of steps:
- $V=\frac{E}{Q}$ where $E$ is energy and $Q$ is charge, $E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ so the SI units for energy is $kgm^2s^{-2}$
  (the units for speed (v) are $ms^{-1}$ so squaring these gives $m^2s^{-2}$)
- $Q=It$ (where I is current) so the units for Q are As (Ampere seconds)
- $V=\frac{kgm^2s^{-2}}{As} \therefore V=kgm^2s^{-3}A^{-1}$  

Below are **prefixes** which could be added before any of the SI units:

| Name | Symbol | Multiplier |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Tera   | T       | $10^{12}$           |
| Giga   | G       | $10^{9}$           |
| Mega   | M       | $10^{6}$           |
| Kilo   | k       | $10^{3}$           |
| Centi  | c       | $10^{-2}$           |
| Mili   | m       | $10^{-3}$           |
| Micro  | $\micro$       | $10^{-6}$           |
| Nano   | n       | $10^{-9}$           |
| Pico   | p       | $10^{-12}$           |
| Femto  | f       | $10^{-15}$           |

For example: 
- $6pF$ (picofarads) is $6 \times 10^{-12}F$
- $9G\ohm$ (gigaohms) is $9 \times 10^9 \ohm$
- $10\micro m$ (micrometres) is $10 x 10^{-6}m$

Converting mega electron volts to joules:
$1eV = 1.6\times10^{-19}J$
	e.g. convert $76\, MeV$ to joules:
		First convert from $MeV$ to $eV$ by multiplying by $10^6$, $76 \, MeV = 76 \times 10^{6} eV$.
		Then convert to joules by multiplying by $1.6\times10^{-19}$,
		$1.216\times10^{-11} \, J$
Converting $kWh$ (kilowatt hours) to Joules:
$1kW = 1000\,J/s$    1 hour = $3600s$
	$1kWh = 1000\times3600$ 
				$= 3.6\times10^6\,J$
				$= 3.6\, MJ$

# Limitations of Physical Measurements

**Random Errors** affect *precision*, meaning they cause differences in measurements which causes a spread about the mean. You **cannot** get rid of all random errors. An example of a random error is *electronic noise* in the circuit of an electrical instrument.
To reduce random errors:
- Take **at least 3 repeats** and calculate a **mean**, this method also allows *anomalies* to be identified.
- Use **computers/data loggers/cameras** to reduce human error and enable smaller *intervals*
- Use **appropriate equipment**, e.g a micrometer has a higher resolution 
  ($0.1\,mm$) than a ruler ($1\,mm$)
  
**Systematic errors** affect *accuracy* and occur due to the apparatus or faults in the experimental method. Systematic errors cause all results to be *too high* or *too low* by the *same amount* each time.
An example is a balance that isn't zeroed correctly (zero error) or reading a scale at a different angle (parallax error).
To reduce systematic error:
- **Calibrate** apparatus by measuring a known value (e.g weigh 1 kg on a mass balance), if the reading is inaccurate then the systematic error is easily identified.
- In radiation experiments, correct for background radiation by measuring it beforehand and excluding it from final results.
- Read the meniscus (the central curve on the surface of a liquid) at eye level (to reduce parallax error) and use controls in experiments.
### Precision
Precise measurements are consistent, they fluctuate slightly about a mean value - this doesn't indicate the value is accurate.
### Repeatability
If the original experimenter can redo the experiment with the same equipment and method then get the same results it is repeatable.
### Reproducibility
If the experiment is redone by a different person or with different techniques and equipment and the same results are found, it is reproducible.
### Resolution
The smallest change in the quantity being measured that gives a recognisable change in reading.
### Accuracy
A measurement close to the true value is accurate
